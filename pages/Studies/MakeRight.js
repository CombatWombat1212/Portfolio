                3D printing has a vast potential to benefit everyday consumers.
              </p>
              <p>In the early 2010s, we were told they would be found in every home; giving consumer’s the power to create anything. But its barriers were too great to reach these expectations, and this reality fell flat. Now, 3D printing hardly has any impact on the average consumer’s life.</p>

            <Description>
              <p>Owning a 3D printer is a steep upfront investment, and learning to use it is a massive time sink. Even then, users without 3D modelling experience will still be restricted to making premade objects.</p>
              <p>There needs to be a way to eliminate these barriers so that 3D printing can reach its full potential. Allowing average consumers to access the benefits of the technology.</p>
