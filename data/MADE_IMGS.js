The switcher node is then plugged into the shirt object on the right side of the animation.  Even though all 3 pattern nodes on the left are plugged into the switcher, only the first has a 'live' connection which is fully opaque compared to the rest.  This was decided by a numeric dial on the switcher node which currently reads '1'.  As a result, the switcher assigns the first material to the shirt.  The animation is then built around the numeric dial being changed to '2' and '3' to show how with each value change, a different pattern in the sequence is selected and assigned to the shirt.",
