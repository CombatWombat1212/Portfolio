Here is an example of a completed entry:
  maker_screen_17: {
    name: "maker_screen_17",
    src: "./assets/images/case_studies/makeright/final_screens/maker/maker_screen_17.png",
    width: 3840,

    section: "Job/Test Complete",
    title: "Customer Feedback",
    phase: "3/3",
    description: ["Allows the maker to review the customer’s response to their submitted images.  They can see the rating and feedback provided by the customer, much like an uber driver receives a rating after a job.", "If the customer accepts and verifies the images then it’s time to mail the object.", "If they reject the object, they may have to reprint and correct their mistake.", "In the case of the maker test, this page shows their results.  If they’ve passed, all that’s left is to complete a short video call, much like an uber driver’s last onboarding step would be an in-person inspection of themselves and their vehicle."],
    actions: [],
    alt: "A screen for makers to review customer feedback on their completed job order, including rating and feedback, and instructions for next steps.",
  },

I need the description, and actions to be an array of strings based on any line breaks they may contain. Please ensure that their name, src, width, height, and group are unchanged. The new additions to the object are as follows: section (string), title (string), phase (string, format of [number]/[number]), description (array of strings), and alt (string). Alt can be left as a blank string.

Please do this for customer_screen_18 through customer_screen_19
